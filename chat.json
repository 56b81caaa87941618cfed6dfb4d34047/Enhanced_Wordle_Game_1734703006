        "content": "\nI have implemented the WordleBet_v1 contract based on your instructions. Here's a summary of what I did:\n\n1. Created a contract with functions for creating games, accepting games, making guesses, and determining winners.\n2. Implemented a Game struct to store game details and a mapping to keep track of games.\n3. Added events for important actions like game creation, acceptance, guesses, and game completion.\n4. Used OpenZeppelin's SafeMath, ReentrancyGuard, and Ownable for security and ownership management.\n5. Implemented a simple mechanism for determining the winner based on guess correctness.\n\nCaveats and assumptions:\n- The contract assumes that the game creator provides the correct word hash when creating the game.\n- There's no time limit for guesses or game completion, which could lead to stalled games.\n- In case of a tie (both players guess correctly), the pot is split.\n- If both players guess incorrectly, the contract keeps the funds.\n\nTo deploy and interact with this contract:\n1. Deploy the contract ensuring you're using Solidity 0.8.20 and have OpenZeppelin 4.9.3 available.\n2. Users can create games by calling `createGame` with a bet amount and the hash of the correct word.\n3. Other users can accept games by calling `acceptGame` with the game ID and matching bet amount.\n4. Players make guesses using the `makeGuess` function.\n5. The game automatically finishes and distributes winnings when both players have made their guesses.\n6. The contract owner can withdraw any funds kept by the contract using the `withdrawFunds` function.\n\nRemember to thoroughly test the contract and consider implementing additional features like time limits or dispute resolution mechanisms for a more robust system.\n",

Added a setFeePercentage function to allow the owner to change the fee (max 10%).\n5. Modified the _finishGame function to include fee collection and distribution.\n6. Removed SafeMath usage as it's not necessary for Solidity 0.8.20.\n7. Added a new event FeesCollected to track fee collections.\n\nThe contract is now ready for deployment without any constructor arguments. The fee collector address is set to 0x25a5674f3D6Afb27e20820063B4fE2786bcB2e6D as requested. \n\nPlease note that the contract owner can change the fee percentage using the setFeePercentage function, but it's capped at 10% to prevent abuse. The fees are collected and sent to the fee collector address whenever a game finishes.\n",
